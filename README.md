To view the methods and results of the analysis, open 'analysis_main.html' in any web browser. To manipulate the code in a RMarkdown document, open 'analysis_main.Rmd' in RStudio. As described in the document, the recommended workflow for reproducing our analysis is to begin by loading all proxy data from the .RData file, and then proceeding with the analysis. Alternatively, individual proxies can be loaded using the "load_indv_data.R" script.
